  × Failed to download and build `scikit-learn==1.4.2`
  ├─▶ Failed to resolve requirements from
  │   `build-system.requires`
  ├─▶ No solution found when resolving: `setuptools`,
  │   `wheel`, `cython>=3.0.8`, `numpy==2.0.0rc1`,
  │   `scipy>=1.6.0`
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of numpy==2.0.0rc1 and
      you require numpy==2.0.0rc1, we can conclude that your
      requirements are unsatisfiable.
